![Globe Logo][]

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/makepanic/globe.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/makepanic/globe)


JavaScript application to search and view details for Tor relays and bridges.
All the data comes from the [Tor Onionoo API][].  Uses [Ember.js][] as
Javascript framework.  Inspired by the official [Tor Atlas][] project.

Tor Onionoo is not affiliated with the Tor project.  "Tor" and the "Onion Logo"
are registered trademarks of The Tor Project, Inc.


## Use the Application

To use a hosted version of Globe, [click here][].  If you want to build your
own version, take a look at the [grunt targets](#grunt-targets) section.

If you can't or don't want to build the application on your own, you can
download the latest archived release from [the release page][].


## Features

- Search for bridges or relays.
- Advanced search with country, running, flags and other filters.
- Details for a bridge or relay.
- Interactive graphs using dygraphs.
- Shareable links for searches or details.


## Installation

Globe is tested and build with nodejs (0.10.x).  For an easy overview on how
to install node on your distribution look at
[Installing Node.js via Package Manager][] -- or, more preferably: [nvm][].

In addition to that, Globe can be built in a virtual machine that is managed
using [Vagrant][].  To make it easier for you, we provide a [Vagrantfile][]
that builds an ubuntu (12.04) virtual machine with everything necessary for
developing and building Globe.  If you have vagrant installed run `vagrant up`
and wait until everything is ready.

**NOTE**: By default, Vagrant will expose the local Globe instance on
[http://localhost:1337][].  So if you want to view the Globe site in your
browser, you can do so there.

Connect to your running virtual machine via `vagrant ssh`.  Using the shared
folder (`cd /vagrant/`) you can continue building Globe using the following
commands.


### Summary:

1. `npm install` (not necessary in the vagrant machine)
2. `grunt`
3. `node app.js`
4. In your browser, visit [http://localhost:1337][].


### Explanation

1. First you need all the npm dependencies. Run `npm install`.

2. Now you're ready to build the application and start the server.  Call
   `grunt` and wait for it to complete the build process.  Grunt pre-compiles
   the handlebars templates, combines all the different JavaScript and CSS
   files and minifies them.  This can take a while depending on your computer.

3. If it's done start the server using `node app.js`. This will start a simple
   [Express.js][] server that handles the requests.

If you only want to get the required html, JavaScript and CSS files see the
**Standalone grunt target** below.


### Grunt Targets


#### Development Target - `grunt dev`

- Useful for local development.
- Uses not minified js and css.
- Uses `grunt watch` to update the server after making code changes.


#### Standalone Target - `grunt standalone`

- Useful to create a minified version that is easy to deploy to your server.
- Minifies all the js and css files.
- Creates a `/build` folder that has all the required resources.
- Used to build the resources for the running application.


#### Standalone Target with Archive - `grunt standalone-archive`

- Same as `grunt standalone`, but creates archive of the build directory.
- Used for to create release files on Github.


#### Continuous Integration Target - `grunt ci`

- Same targets as `grunt standalone` with additional testing of the generated
  files using [karma][].
- Used for Travis continuous integration.


#### Default Target - `grunt`

- Same as `standalone` except it won't create a build folder with all the
  resources.
